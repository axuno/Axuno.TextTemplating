# Axuno.TextTemplating

Text templating is used to dynamically render contents based on a template and a model.

* It is based on the [Scriban library](https://github.com/lunet-io/scriban), so it supports conditional logics, loops and much more.
* Template content can be localized.
* You can define layout templates to be used as the layout while rendering other templates.
* You can pass arbitrary objects to the template context (beside the model) for advanced scenarios.

The library is a modified version of [Volo.Abp.TextTemplating](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/tree/dev/framework/src/Volo.Abp.TextTemplating/Volo/Abp/TextTemplating) 3.3
